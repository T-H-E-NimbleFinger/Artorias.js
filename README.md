# Comunity-colaborations.js

Hello all,

i have created this repository for beginner and intermediate level javascript coders to learn the language better, share their ideas and experiment on projects while colaborating with others.

there is no specific purpose i have of this repository other than that great ideas will come from it and that people can always come here to learn.

please post any javascript related files you would like to and share what you would like to do with them. if you would like to post somthin, shoot me a message and i will gladly authorize you to do so.

I will be available whenevr i can but i will not be able to be here all the time. Please have patience when asking for authorization. 

Please try not to be unreasonably negative although constructive criticisim is supported. 

Finally, if there are any great artist out there i would love if we could colaborate on a logo for this new community. If so please send me a message and i am shure we can create somthing great.
